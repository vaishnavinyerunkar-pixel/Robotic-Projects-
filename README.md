# Robotic-Projects
🤖 Project Title (Replace With Your Project Name)

Short one-line description of the project.
Example: A 3D printed robotic hand controlled using OpenCV-based gesture recognition and mobile interface.

📌 Overview

This project focuses on building a brief explanation of what the system does.
Explain the goal, what problem it solves, and what makes it unique.

Example:

Real-time gesture-controlled robotic system

Integration of computer vision with hardware

Wireless/mobile-based control

🎯 Objectives

Design and develop the hardware system

Implement real-time control logic

Integrate OpenCV / IoT / Embedded system

Achieve smooth and responsive automation

🛠 Components Used
🔹 Hardware

Arduino / ESP32 / ESP8266

Servo Motors / DC Motors

Sensors (if any)

Power Supply

3D Printed Parts

🔹 Software

Python

OpenCV

Arduino IDE

Embedded C/C++

Mobile App (if applicable)

🧠 System Architecture

Explain how your system works step-by-step:

Camera captures input

OpenCV processes image

Gesture/object detected

Command sent to microcontroller

Actuators perform action

You can also insert a system flow diagram here:

Camera → OpenCV → Serial/WiFi → Microcontroller → Motors/Servos

⚙️ Working Principle

Describe the logic:

Image processing technique used

Detection algorithm (contours, Haar cascade, Mediapipe, etc.)

Communication protocol (Serial/WiFi/Bluetooth)

Control logic

Explain clearly but technically.
